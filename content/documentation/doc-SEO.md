### SEO Overview

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is about how to get search engines like Google to rank one website higher than the others. Some search engines will change their algorithms for SEO. Key Performance Index (KPI) is used for measuring the search results. It can be tracked by using the database to capture the information.

There are ways to optimize the search results. SEO looks for information in H1 tags and works down to H6 tags. Each webpage should hold only one H1 tag, and it should contain the most important information of the page. Ghost pages or hidden text should be avoided. They will lead to lower SEO score. Backlinks can be helpful if they are legitimate and content-based, quality links combined with good content and structure favor good organic search results.

### SEO Proposal

SEO implementation is crucial to help generate organic traffic to a website. That being said, first thing to do is to better understand my target audience and then create a strategic, data-driven SEO plan.

Before getting into the technical tasks, I will take a look at my target audience, consider what search results will meet their specific needs and what I could do or put in my website to make it more favorable than other websites in the market. Think of personas and define my target audience, which will then help to prioritize content to suit the audiences. Based on what the audiences want, I can do a keyword research, and get the picture of what is generally being searched, and optimize my website content. Categorize the searches and prioritize the results, I can write down recommendations based on what I found in the searches, that will be helpful to the SEO plan.

It will then be time to see which websites could be my competitors, and compare my website against theirs in areas like features, links and traffic. Document the results on spreadsheet for further elaboration.

After knowing the target audience, doing the keyword research and categorize them, comparing mine to some competitors' websites, then summarize the key results, look into issues if there are any, then set prioritization for the implementation, rewrite title tags, meta tags and URLs etc., check on responsive design and improve structured data. As expert, authoritative and trustworthy (E-A-T) are keys to high SEO, and good backlinks helps higher SEO, I can seek partners to work with and so we can display links for one another. All these details will help improve my website's SEO, as they all contribute to advance my website to be good-structured and with good content and quality links, make my website more user-friendly and attractive to my target audience.
